CLASS NEVER RUNS SCARED. IT IS SURE-FOOTED AND CONFIDENT, AND IT CAN HANDLE
WHATEVER COMES ALONG. CLASS HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR. IT KNOWS THAT A GOOD LAUGH IS
THE BEST LUBRICANT FOR OILING THE MACHINERY OF HUMAN RELATIONS. CLASS NEVER
MAKES EXCUSES. IT TAKES ITS LUMPS AND LEARNS FROM MISTAKES. CLASS KNOWS THAT
GOOD MANNERS ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A SERIES OF SMALL SACRIFICES AND MINOR
INCONVENIENCES. CLASS BESPEAKS AN ARISTOCRACY UNRELATED TO ANCESTORS OR MONEY.
SOME EXTREMELY WEALTHY PEOPLE HAVE NO CLASS AT ALL, WHILE OTHERS WHO ARE
STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET ARE LOADED WITH IT. CLASS IS REAL. YOU CAN'T FAKE
IT. CLASS IS COMFORTABLE IN ITS OWN SKIN. IT NEVER PUTS ON AIRS. CLASS NEVER
TRIES TO BUILD ITSELF UP BY TEARING OTHERS DOWN. CLASS IS ALREADY UP AND NEED
NOT ATTEMPT TO LOOK BETTER BY MAKING OTHERS LOOK WORSE. CLASS CAN WALK WITH
KINGS AND KEEP ITS VIRTUE AND TALK WITH CROWDS AND KEEP THE COMMON TOUCH.
EVERYONE IS COMFORTABLE WITH THE PERSON WHO HAS CLASS BECAUSE HE IS COMFORTABLE
WITH HIMSELF. IF YOU HAVE CLASS, YOU'VE GOT IT MADE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE CLASS, NO
MATTER WHAT ELSE YOU HAVE, IT WON'T MAKE UP FOR IT.

OUR DEEPEST FEAR IS NOT THAT WE ARE INADEQUATE. OUR DEEPEST FEAR IS THAT WE ARE
POWERFUL BEYOND MEASURE. IT IS OUR LIGHT, NOT OUR DARKNESS, THAT MOST FRIGHTENS

ABOUT SHRINKING SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE WON'T FEEL INSECURE AROUND YOU. WE ARE ALL
MEANT TO SHINE AS CHILDREN DO. IT'S NOT JUST IN SOME OF US; IT IS IN EVERYONE.

PERMISSION TO DO THE SAME. AS WE ARE LIBERATED FROM OUR OWN FEAR, OUR PRESENCE
AUTOMATICALLY LIBERATES OTHERS.

IF THE WORLD SEEMS COLD TO YOU, KINDLE FIRES TO WARM IT.
    -- LUCY LARCOM

HELPING, FIXING AND SERVING REPRESENT THREE DIFFERENT WAYS OF SEEING LIFE. WHEN
YOU HELP, YOU SEE LIFE AS WEAK. WHEN YOU FIX, YOU SEE LIFE AS BROKEN. WHEN YOU
SERVE, YOU SEE LIFE AS WHOLE. FIXING AND HELPING MAY BE THE WORK OF THE EGO, AND
SERVICE THE WORK OF THE SOUL.

TO BEAR DEFEAT WITH DIGNITY, TO ACCEPT CRITICISM WITH POISE, TO RECEIVE HONORS
WITH HUMILITY -- THESE ARE MARKS OF MATURITY AND GRACIOUSNESS.
    -- WILLIAM ARTHUR WARD

@

SELF-ACCEPTANCE COMES FROM MEETING LIFE'S CHALLENGES VIGOROUSLY. DON'T NUMB
YOURSELF TO YOUR TRIALS AND DIFFICULTIES, NOR BUILD MENTAL WALLS TO EXCLUDE PAIN
FROM YOUR LIFE. YOU WILL FIND PEACE NOT BY TRYING TO ESCAPE YOUR PROBLEMS, BUT
BY CONFRONTING THEM COURAGEOUSLY. YOU WILL FIND PEACE NOT IN DENIAL, BUT IN
VICTORY.

I LOVE THE MAN THAT CAN SMILE IN TROUBLE, THAT CAN GATHER STRENGTH FROM

YOU CAN GAIN MORE FRIENDS BY BEING YOURSELF THAN YOU CAN BY PUTTING UP A FRONT.
YOU CAN GAIN MORE FRIENDS BY BUILDING PEOPLE UP THAN YOU CAN BY TEARING THEM

A DIFFERENCE ONE PERSON CAN MAKE!

EVERYBODY CAN BE GREAT. BECAUSE ANYBODY CAN SERVE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A

PHYSICS TO SERVE. YOU ONLY NEED A HEART FULL OF GRACE. A SOUL GENERATED BY LOVE.

THE TEST OF A FIRST-RATE INTELLIGENCE IS THE ABILITY TO HOLD TWO OPPOSED IDEAS

FOR A LONG TIME IT HAD SEEMED TO ME THAT LIFE WAS ABOUT TO BEGIN -- REAL LIFE.
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME OBSTACLE IN THE WAY, SOMETHING TO BE GOTTEN THROUGH

THEN LIFE WOULD BEGIN. AT LAST IT DAWNED ON ME THAT THESE OBSTACLES WERE MY
LIFE.

WE MUST CONTINUALLY REMIND STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM THAT EXPRESSION OF

WORKED FOR A MAN I WOULD WORK FOR HIM. I WOULD NOT WORK FOR HIM A PART OF THE

SERVICE OR NONE. IF PUT TO THE PINCH, AN OUNCE OF LOYALTY IS WORTH A POUND OF

IF A MAN DOES NOT MAKE NEW ACQUAINTANCE AS HE ADVANCES THROUGH LIFE, HE WILL
SOON FIND HIMSELF LEFT ALONE. A MAN, SIR, SHOULD KEEP HIS FRIENDSHIP IN CONSTANT
REPAIR.
    -- T.S. ELIOT

@

NOW THE ALTERNATIVE TO DESPAIR IS COURAGE. AND HUMAN LIFE CAN BE VIEWED AS A
CONTINUOUS STRUGGLE BETWEEN THESE TWO OPTIONS. COURAGE IS THE CAPACITY TO AFFIRM
ONE'S LIFE IN SPITE OF THE ELEMENTS WHICH THREATEN IT. THE FACT THAT COURAGE
USUALLY PREDOMINATES OVER DESPAIR IN ITSELF TELLS US SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT
LIFE. IT TELLS YOU THAT THE FORCES THAT AFFIRM LIFE ARE STRONGER THAN THOSE THAT
NEGATE IT.
    -- DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON

@

WE BELONG TO THE COMMUNITY. IT IS NOT THE TAILOR ALONE WHO IS THE NINTH PART OF
A MAN; IT IS AS MUCH THE PREACHER, AND THE MERCHANT, AND THE FARMER. WHERE IS
THIS DIVISION OF LABOR TO END? AND WHAT OBJECT DOES IT FINALLY SERVE? NO DOUBT
ANOTHER MAY ALSO THINK FOR ME; BUT IT IS NOT THEREFORE DESIRABLE THAT HE SHOULD
DO SO TO THE EXCLUSION OF MY THINKING FOR MYSELF.

IT IS THE FORMIDABLE CHARACTER OF THE SPECIES TO ROUTINELY SEEK THE IMPROBABLE,

TOLERATE NOT KNOWING, NOT CURING, NOT HEALING AND FACE WITH US THE REALITY OF

IN THE NAME OF THE BEST WITHIN YOU, DO NOT SACRIFICE THIS WORLD TO THOSE WHO ARE

OF MAN BE DISTORTED BY THE UGLY, THE COWARDLY, THE MINDLESS... DO NOT LET YOUR
FIRE GO OUT, SPARK BY IRREPLACEABLE SPARK, IN THE HOPELESS SWAMPS OF THE
APPROXIMATE, THE NOT-QUITE, THE NOT-YET, THE NOT-AT-ALL. DO NOT LET THE HERO IN
YOUR SOUL PERISH, IN LONELY FRUSTRATION FOR THE LIFE YOU DESERVED, BUT HAVE

WORLD YOU DESIRED CAN BE WON, IT EXISTS, IT IS REAL, IT IS POSSIBLE, IT'S YOURS.

THE MOMENT OF TRUTH, THE SUDDEN EMERGENCE OF A NEW INSIGHT, IS AN ACT OF
INTUITION. SUCH INTUITIONS GIVE THE APPEARANCE OF MIRACULOUS FLUSHES, OR SHORT-
CIRCUITS OF REASONING. IN FACT THEY MAY BE LIKENED TO AN IMMERSED CHAIN, OF

LONG BEFORE I WROTE STORIES, I LISTENED FOR STORIES. LISTENING FOR THEM IS

ENTHUSIASMS, THE GREAT DEVOTIONS, WHO SPENDS HIMSELF FOR A WORTHY CAUSE; WHO, AT
THE BEST, KNOWS, IN THE END, THE TRIUMPH OF HIGH ACHIEVEMENT, AND WHO, AT THE

CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY, EVERY ONE OF US DOES RENDER SOME SERVICE OR OTHER.

BUT THAT OF THE WORLD AT LARGE.

TORCH, A PROMISE. I CHOOSE TO RISK MY SIGNIFICANCE; TO LIVE SO THAT WHICH CAME
TO ME AS A SEED GOES TO THE NEXT AS A BLOSSOM AND THAT WHICH CAME TO ME AS A
BLOSSOM, GOES ON AS FRUIT.

OF LEGS FOR A HORSE. BUT THE ONLY NUMBER THAT IS BOTH EVEN AND ODD IS INFINITY.
THEREFORE, HORSES HAVE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF LEGS. NOW TO SHOW THIS FOR THE

THE TRUTH IS THAT CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY, LIKE EVERY OTHER THEOLOGY, IS NOT ONLY
OPPOSED TO THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT; IT IS ALSO OPPOSED TO ALL OTHER ATTEMPTS AT
RATIONAL THINKING. NOT BY ACCIDENT DOES GENESIS 3 MAKE THE FATHER OF KNOWLEDGE A
SERPENT -- SLIMY, SNEAKING AND ABOMINABLE. SINCE THE EARLIEST DAYS THE CHURCH AS
AN ORGANIZATION HAS THROWN ITSELF VIOLENTLY AGAINST EVERY EFFORT TO LIBERATE THE
BODY AND MIND OF MAN. IT HAS BEEN, AT ALL TIMES AND EVERYWHERE, THE HABITUAL AND
INCORRIGIBLE DEFENDER OF BAD GOVERNMENTS, BAD LAWS, BAD SOCIAL THEORIES, BAD
INSTITUTIONS. IT WAS, FOR CENTURIES, AN APOLOGIST FOR SLAVERY, AS IT WAS THE
APOLOGIST FOR THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS.
    -- H. L. MENCKEN

@

THERE IS, IN FACT, NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY GIVEN NATURAL PHENOMENON,
HOWEVER MARVELOUS IT MAY SEEM TODAY, WILL REMAIN FOREVER INEXPLICABLE. SOON OR
LATE THE LAWS GOVERNING THE PRODUCTION OF LIFE ITSELF WILL BE DISCOVERED IN THE
LABORATORY, AND MAN MAY SET UP BUSINESS AS A CREATOR ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT. THE
THING, INDEED, IS NOT ONLY CONCEIVABLE; IT IS EVEN HIGHLY PROBABLE.
